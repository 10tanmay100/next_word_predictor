# next_word_predictor

I have a built a simple Next Word Predictor using LSTM. Data I have downloaded from wikipedia. I have downloaded almost a huge text data that is all about youtube writtenn by Wikipedia people. Now after training you can put some initiaL text that has to be related with the trained content and you can specify number of words you want to predict and it will complete that many words for you accordingly. 


If we want to make it more robust for any kind of scenario we need to train the model on variety topics and contexts so that it can be able to predict automatically in general or any specific context.
